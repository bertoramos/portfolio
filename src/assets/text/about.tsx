const greetings = `Hi! I'm Alberto,`
const about_txt = `a passionate computer scientist with a strong background in the exciting world of technology.

With a degree in Computer Science (ULPGC) and a Master's degree in "Intelligent Systems and Numerical Applications" (SIANI - ULPGC), I have developed specialised skills in the field of machine learning and robotics, where my passion lies in creating revolutionary solutions that integrate artificial intelligence with engineering to significantly transform our environment.

I have had the privilege of working in dynamic and collaborative environments, which has strengthened my ability to communicate effectively and work in teams.

In addition to my technical expertise, I have a proactive approach to continuous learning and constantly updating my skills to keep up with the latest trends in the industry. I strongly believe in the importance of innovation and am always looking for ways to apply new technologies to solve business challenges.

Currently, I am actively engaged in pursuing my PhD, specializing in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and business field.

When I am not coding, I explore a diversity of activities that enrich my life. My passion for technology leads me to explore new trends and applications. In addition, I find balance in sports such as surfski, running, cycling and swimming, which not only keep me fit, but also help me recharge and stay focused. In my peaceful moments, I enjoy creative activities such as embroidery, crochet, photography and painting, which allow me to disconnect and develop my artistic side. 

I eagerly look forward to the opportunity to bring my experience and passion to teams that value technical excellence and creativity in the field of computer engineering.

Feel free to say hello. I'll be excited to hear from you.

Take care and stay awesome!`
